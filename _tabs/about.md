My name is Juan Diaz. I am originally from Colombia, but recently moved to Asheville, NC. I have completed an A.A.S in Web Technologies at Central Piedmont Community College in Charlotte, NC. I enjoy developing new skills in both front and back-end development and I am passionate about Full stack Web Development. Currently, I have a few years of experience as a Service Desk Analyst. However, I am looking forward to working with a Startup company that allows for professional and personal growth. I value discipline, loyalty, reliability, and self-motivation above all else.

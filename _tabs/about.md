Hello, my name is Juan Diaz. I am originally from Colombia but have relocated to Asheville, NC. I have completed an A.A.S. in Web Technologies at Central Piedmont Community College in Charlotte, NC. I am deeply interested in developing new skills in both front end and back-end development, and I am particularly passionate about Full Stack Web Development. Although I have gained valuable experience as a Service Desk Analyst over the past few years, I am eagerly seeking opportunities with a startup company that offers professional and personal growth. I value on discipline, loyalty, reliability, and self-motivation above all else.

"[The HTML and CSS Final Course](https://platzi.com/cursos/html-css/ "Curso Definitivo de HTML y CSS")" is one of the Platzi courses I took. In which I learned HTML and CSS from scratch, without prior knowledge. Learned all about HTML tags, semantics, CSS, how to style website elements, EM/REM measurements, box model and much more. I had previous experience but it helped me to get back and refresh some concepts to start my path as a web developer.

This course is part of a [Platzi Challenge](https://platzi.com/blog/portafolio-web-2022/) I participated on. In which for two months, I got the oportunity to join 24 live meeting and multiple classes with the only purpose of creating a Web Portaflio.

Here are some of the projects that have been developed through this course.

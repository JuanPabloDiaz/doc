This repo is part of a Platzi course called: "[Curso Pr√°ctico de HTML y CSS](https://platzi.com/cursos/html-practico/)". Now that I completed the **HTML and CSS Definitive Course** and I refreshed my knowledge on HTML and CSS. I am ready for this practical course. Creating pages using what I had learned on the other class.
I also reinforce concepts such as positioning, box model, Display types, selectors such as classes, IDS, Flexbox and Grid.

## Challenge üé≤

I developed some projects but the most challenging was to **clone the Google page**.

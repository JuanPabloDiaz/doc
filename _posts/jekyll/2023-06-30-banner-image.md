Have you ever desired to incorporate an image at the beginning of your Jekyll post but lacked the knowledge on how to accomplish it? Fear not, for it is a simple task requiring only a small portion of code.

You can watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6oKO-7gsM4s&t=725s) below and follow along with this post, which explains how I added a banner image at the beginning of all my posts. Yes, that's rightâ€”for every single post, even those without an image set by me. It automatically uses a default image for all those posts where I didn't set one.

{% include embed/youtube.html id='6oKO-7gsM4s' %}

<summary>My Responsabilities</summary>

Ok. I've added you to the repo. You should now be able to merge pull requests.

Here are some guidelines I follow:

- add only developer related conferences
- no webinars
- no marketing events
- no hackathons
- check whether the topic really fits to the conference
- no medicine related conferences - we get a lot of PRs for surgery conferences
- no Semiconductors, Optoelectronics and Nanostructures conferences like [#6776](https://github.com/tech-conferences/conference-data/pull/6776)
- a conference must include talks - events like roadshows or conventions without talks are no conferences
- a conference is an event which has at least 3-4 people from different companies. events where only people from company present are not really conferences for me
- shorten the URL as much as possible
- shorten the conference name as much as possible
- check for duplicates before merging
- the conference name should not contain the year or location - not always possible
- check whether the website is reachable
- check whether the CFP page is reachable
- check whether the twitter URL is correct
- check the dates, especially the month and year - sometimes people mix up numbers
- check whether the website contains information about the conference and is not a list of multiple conferences or a blog post - I usually just merge PRs where there is a dedicated webpage available
- remove tracker parameters from URLs - make the URL as clean as possible. This helps with duplicate detection.
- check whether the URL is the original URL - we sometimes get PRs where there is a website which adds an advertisement frame around a real conference
- reorder the conferences using `npm run reorder-confs` from time to time - this prevents ugly merge conflicts
- be careful with merge conflicts - if you're not careful you can delete valid conferences or add removed conferences
- if you add a new location - I usually try to use the US english name of the location
- locations in the US must have the state like `San Francisco, CA`
- if you want to add a location which is close to a larger location, I often choose the larger location instead. For example if a conference is close to Detroit, I would rather change the conference location to Detroit than adding a small suburb of Detroit. It's not always simple - in case of doubt you can also ask me
- If you have a conference for multiple topics and you want to change details, you need to adapt the details for all topics
- The topic general should be used alone - I would not mix JAVA and General. It's either or.
- Don't add topics too easy - people sometimes ask to add frameworks or libraries. You need to adapt at least 3-4 places in different projects to add a new topic. It's not that simple.
- don't merge a PR if the checks fail
- run `npm run test` before pushing
- try to keep the test script as fast as possible. Currently the runtime is about 100-200ms
- If you commit/push directly instead of using the new conference form run `npm run reorder-confs` before pushing to avoid merge conflicts.

It think that's all for now. Have fun merging and welcome to the team.
